# FLOW-PROOF-Beginner-Course-Module6

 In the FLOW PROOF ( Beginner Course ) from the Metacrafters,  I have learned about how to deploy a smart contract on Flow for minting a NFT, depositing it and also see its metadata. 

### Executing program
For executing the program firstly we will Copy and Paste the code in online Flow Playground, always remember to paste transaction and script code also, then we will input the data using Transaction code and then we will execute the Script to get the output.
