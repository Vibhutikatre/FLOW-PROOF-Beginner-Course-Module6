# FLOW-PROOF-Beginner-Course-Module6

 In the FLOW PROOF ( Beginner Course ) of the Metacrafters, from the previous modules i have gained sufficient knowledge about how to create a smart contract using cadence language and in this particular 6th module also I have learned cleaarly about deploying a smart contract on the Flow for minting any NFT, then how to deposit it and then how to see its metadata.
I learned about how to deploy a NFT smart contract named cryptopoops where after deploying i was able to send it to another account and see its metadata.All this was done in the cadence language on Flow chain. 

### Executing program
For executing the program firstly we will Copy and Paste the code in online Flow Playground, always remember to paste transaction and script code also, then we will input the data using Transaction code and then we will execute the Script to get the output.
