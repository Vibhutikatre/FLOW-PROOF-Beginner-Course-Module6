# FLOW-PROOF-Beginner-Course-Module6

 In the FLOW PROOF ( Beginner Course ) from the Metacrafters, due to gaining sufficient knowledge about how to create a smart contract using cadance language from the previously studied all modules in the 6th module also I have learned cleaarly about deploying a smart contract on the Flow for minting any NFT, then how to deposit it and then how to see its metadata.

### Executing program
For executing the program firstly we will Copy and Paste the code in online Flow Playground, always remember to paste transaction and script code also, then we will input the data using Transaction code and then we will execute the Script to get the output.
